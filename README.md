Run the program from MandalApp.py.

Generates a specified sequence of images for a Mandelbrot Zoom animation.

Provides an interface to input a specific point to which the animation zooms into by a factor which is also specified by the user.

The interface also provides the opportunity to adjust:
  - the dimensions of the image
  - the initial and final maximum amount of iterations by which the mandelbrot formula functions
  - the total amount of frames and at which frame to start rendering the animation at
  - the color range of the rendered images #I plan in the future to present this in a moreintuitive manner with something like a color whell rather than representing it as a solid bar or line

Furthermore, one may adjust the internal parameters of the image generator function to aquire vastly different results. #Future plan to implement these parameters in and becomes availble for adjustment within the user interface

Planned additions:
  - several default options to choose from as far as the look of the image and the manner in which the animation appears
