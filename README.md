Run the program from MandalApp.py.

Generates a specified sequence of images for a Mandelbrot Zoom animation.

Provides an interface to input a specific point to which the animation zooms into by a factor which is also specified by the user.

The interface also provides the opportunity to adjust:
  - the dimensions of the image
  - the initial and final maximum amount of iterations by which the mandelbrot formula functions
  - the total amount of frames and at which frame to start rendering the animation at
  - the color range of the rendered images
